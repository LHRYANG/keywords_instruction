- Each phrase should be descriptive, suitable for use in visual editing prompts or image descriptions, such as:
    ("The fluffy dog is barking loudly.", "The fluffy dog is sniffing curiously.") if attributes are used,
    or ("Here is a girl that is laughing.", "Here is a girl that is crying loudly.") otherwise.
- The object in each phrase should remain the same â€” and the motion (action) should change.
- You may add **adverbs** to modify the motion (e.g., "running quickly", "barking loudly") to make it more expressive and natural.
- Use **diverse and meaningful motion changes**, as long as they are visually plausible for the object.

Output only the result as a Python list of string pairs, in the format:
